My Rust code is abhorrent. I have so many unwraps in there. I tried getting form submission to work, but multer was giving me extremely unhelpful errors. Why does everything take so long? I should have just used PHP.

...I'm sure Rust is a lovely language, and I'd like to get to know it better under different circumstances. But it is not something you can pick up in an hour a day for two weeks.
